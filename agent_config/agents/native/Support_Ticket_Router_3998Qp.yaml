  This agent automatically categorizes incoming support tickets based on priority (URGENT, NORMAL, or LOW), generates a suggested reply, and routes the ticket to the correct Slack channel. For each ticket:
  1. Analyze the priority using a generative model.
  2. Route URGENT tickets to #urgent-tickets, NORMAL tickets to #support-queue, and LOW tickets to #general-feedback in Slack.
  3. Include sender name, email subject, ticket body, and suggested reply in each Slack notification.
  4. Notify the appropriate operations team in Slack for urgent tickets.
